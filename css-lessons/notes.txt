CSS lesson notes:
  Chaining selectors:
    - by doing .class1.class2 {} it will look for elements that have both class1 and class2 applied to them.
    - by doing .class1, class2 {} it will apply the given css to both classes if the share similar traits.
    - by doing .ancestor .class {} any element that has the .class and is a child of a element with the class ancestor will get the style
  
  Properties:
    - color: sets the elements text color
    - background-color: sets the background color of the element 
    - font-family
    - font-size
    - font-weight
    - text-align

  The Cascade of CSS:
    - styles get applied in the order of specificity:
      - Inline styles
      - Id selectors
      - Class selectors
      - Type selectors

      Example: a style with selectors ".main .list{}" will be applied over a style with one selector like ".subsection1{}"

    Basically the style that has more specificity will always be applied.

  Inheritance:
    - If a child inherits a style from its parent but it has its own class assigned to it, it will takes it class rather than
      the inherited style 

  Rule order:
    - The tie breaker is if the styles are all on the same order of specificity then the last one declared in the css sheet will be applied.

  Three ways of applying css to an html file:
    - using: <link rel="stylesheet" href="pathToFile">
    - using: <style> Your css goes here </style>
    - using: <element style="your css goes here">
