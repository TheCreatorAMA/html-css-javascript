Flexbox notes:
  Flex container: A container that holds flex items and has its own unique properties that can be applied. To make a flex container all you
                  you do is set "display: flex;"

  Flex item: a item that exists in a flex container. A flex item can also be created by setting "display: flex;".

  NOTE: A flex item can also be a flex container. The same goes the other way but just think about it this way. If a element has a parent that
        has the display set to flex it is a flex item and if the element has no parent that has display set to flex and its display is set to flex
        it is a flex container.
