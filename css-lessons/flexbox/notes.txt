Flexbox notes:
  Flex container: A container that holds flex items and has its own unique properties that can be applied. To make a flex container all you
                  you do is set "display: flex;"

  Flex item: a item that exists in a flex container. A flex item can also be created by setting "display: flex;".

  NOTE: A flex item can also be a flex container. The same goes the other way but just think about it this way. If a element has a parent that
        has the display set to flex it is a flex item and if the element has no parent that has display set to flex and its display is set to flex
        it is a flex container.


More on flex property:
  
  When you define the property "flex: 1;" it actually is short hand for 3 seperate properties. 
  the properties are "flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis;"

  flex-grow: tells you how much of the container is takes up. if three elements are in a container and all have a flex-grow of 1 they will all
             take up the same amount of space. However, if they containers have a flex gorw of (1, 2, 1) the one with flex-grow 2 will take up 2/3 of
             the container. Think about it as fractions.
  flex-shrink: Lets you specify how much the element should shrink by if it is larger than its parent container.
  flex-basis: Lets you specify the starting size of the flex item. when doing short hand notation "flex: 1" flex-basis is set to 0, however, when it 
              is defined as its own property flex-basis is set to auto. auto makes it look for a width decleration.

  NOTE ON flex-shrink and flex-grow:
    these properties will override the width property if it is given.
