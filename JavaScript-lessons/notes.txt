JavaScript notes:

Variables:
    - Think of them as a container
    - Three ways to define a variable
        - var: old school way to define variables but is similar to let.
        - let: Define a normal variable that can be assigned down the road
        - const: Defines a constant that should be changed after being declared
    - Naming convention
        - can only contain letter, numbers and the symbols $ or _
        - camelCase variables that have multiple words
        - case matters! (apple APPLE are two different variables)
    - Constants:
        - Constants should be all upper case if the value is known before running the code
        such as GRAVITY = 9.81;. However, constants that will be assigned during runtime should
        not be labeled with all upper case.
