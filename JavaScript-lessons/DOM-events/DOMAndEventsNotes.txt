Answer these questions after finishing.zzs

Explain what the DOM is in relation to a webpage.


Explain the difference between a “node” and an “element”.


Explain how to target nodes with “selectors”.


Explain the basic methods for finding/adding/removing and altering DOM nodes.


Explain the difference between a “nodelist” and an “array of nodes”.


Explain what “bubbling” is and how it works.


---------- Notes ----------
DOM stands for "document object model" and when your browser parses your html it builds the DOM which is a tree like structure with nodes
having different relationships.

you use selectors to target notes such as:
    div.display
    .display
    #container > .display
    div#container > div.display

DOM methods that allow you to retrieve elements using selectors:

    element.querySelector(selector) returns a reference to the first match of selector
    element.querySelectorAll(selectors) returns a “nodelist” containing references to all of the matches of the selectors
        ^^NOTE: querySelectorAll does not return an array but a node list. May be needed to convert it to a array using Array.from()

Element Creation

    document.createElement(tagName, [options]) creates a new element of tag type tagName. [options] in this case means you can add some optional parameters to the function. Don’t worry about these at this point.

Then to add elements to the DOM:

Append Elements

    parentNode.appendChild(childNode) appends childNode as the last child of parentNode
    parentNode.insertBefore(newNode, referenceNode) inserts newNode into parentNode before referenceNode
