Clean Code:
    - Use consistent indentation (tabs or spaces pick one)
    - Use semicolons regardless
    - Limit line length
    - When naming things use camel case and begin with a noun or an adjective.

    Other tips for clean code:
        - revise logic before coding (make a flow diagram)
        - write good consice comments.
        - avoid very large functions.
        - summarize imports (better to have fewer files to be imported rather than multiple)
