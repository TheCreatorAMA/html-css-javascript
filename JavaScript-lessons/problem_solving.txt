Guide to problem solving:
    - Take the time to understand the problem before doing anything else
    - Make a plan
        - Does your program have a user interface?
        - What inputs will your program have?
        - What is the desired output?
        - Given the inputs how do you get the desired output?
    - Pseudocode
    - Divide and conquer
        - Break down problem into as many sub-problems as you can.

Example: 
    FizzBuzz:
    Write a program that takes a user's input and prints the numbers from one to the number that the user enetered. However,
    for the multiples of three print Fizz and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For multiples of three and five print 
    FizzBuzz

Understanding the problem:
- user has a place to put input (browser console program)
- print out every number from one to user input ( for loop )
- if number is a multiple of three print Fizz ( number modulo three )
- if number is a multiple of five print Buzz ( number modulo five )
- if number is a multiple of three and five print FizzBuzz ( skip this if we split up checks into two seperate ifs instead of an if else)
